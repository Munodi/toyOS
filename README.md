# toyOS

Originally some old hobby/toy OS code from years ago, I've improved it slightly and it's time for an initial commit.  It was going to be a UNIX-like microkernel, but I never wrote enough for it to be either, and now it's going to be just a microkernel OS.

It looked awful, but I guess that's five-years-ago me. It contains copied tutorial code, some fairly good code, and started-then-abandoned files with grand ideas. I've started to improve the coding style, simplify goals (eg. I planned to allow PAE on i386, which I see as pointless because if you've >4GB then go for AMD64), and getting stuff implemented rather than allowing lots of unfinished files.
